				<h2>Egg boiling</h2>
				<p>
					Eggs consist of proteins which denature when heat is applied. They lose their shape and become long strands rather than tight masses. They then tangle with each other causing the liquid of the egg to become more and more viscous.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most traditional egg timers have a set time of about three minutes, that being the approximate time it takes to cook an average sized hen's egg in water. Hard-boiled eggs take longer to cook. The three minute egg timer is for soft-boiled eggs. The egg changes rapidly during the first few minutes of cooking. The changes cannot be seen through the eggshell, so timing is important.
